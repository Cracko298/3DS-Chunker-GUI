# 3DS-Chunker-GUI
- A fork of the 3DS-Chunker Conversion tool which should (in theory) be a better user-experience.

### Installation
- Run the GUI (`main.py` in the First Directory) and it will install everything needed for World Conversion(s).
- The GUI itself is fully self-contained, and the 3DS-Chunker was modified for easy usability.

## Note
- **This is NOT affiliated with [Chunker](https://chunker.app/)** **an official tool to convert between Java and Bedrock worlds.**
- **The name is inspired by that, however (hopefully it's fair use).**

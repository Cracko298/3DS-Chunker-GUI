# 3DS-Chunker
This is a WIP tool for Converting Worlds to/from 3DS Edition and Java Edition.

### Installation
- Run the GUI (`main.py` in the First Directory) and it will install everything needed for World Conversion(s).
- The GUI itself is fully self-contained, and the 3DS-Chunker was modified for easy usability.

- **The name is inspired by that, however (hopefully it's fair use).**
